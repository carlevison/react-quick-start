# React quick start

This quick start walks you through the basics of transforming and delivering an image from Cloudinary in a React environment.

## Prerequisites

**To perform this quick start, you'll need:**

* A Cloudinary account. If you don't have one yet, you can quickly [register for free](https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free).
* Your product environment credentials. You can find your [credentials](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/how_to_integrate_cloudinary#account_details) on the [API Keys](https://console.cloudinary.com/settings/api-keys) page of the Cloudinary Console Settings. 
  * To use your **API environment variable**, copy the provided format and replace the `<your_api_key>` and `<your_api_secret>` placeholders with the actual values found on the page. Your cloud name will already be correctly included in the format.

## Set up and configure the SDK

### Install the packages

Install the required packages using the NPM package manager:

```
npm i @cloudinary/url-gen @cloudinary/react
```

Note that these packages are already installed for the purposes of this tutorial. 

### Configure Cloudinary

Import `Cloudinary` from `@cloudinary/url-gen` in `App.tsx`:

```ts add={2}
import './App.css'
import { Cloudinary } from "@cloudinary/url-gen";
```

To configure a Cloudinary instance, copy and paste this code into the `App` function, changing `demo` to your cloud name:

```ts add={4-8}
function App() {

  // Create a Cloudinary instance and set your cloud name.
  const cld = new Cloudinary({
    cloud: {
      cloudName: 'demo'
    }
  });

```
