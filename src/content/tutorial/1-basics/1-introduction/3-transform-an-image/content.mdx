# Transform an image

Let's resize the image to make it fit better on the page. Use the `fill` crop to specify a width and height of 250 pixels and fill this area with as much of the original image as possible.

Start by importing `fill` from `@cloudinary/url-gen/actions/resize`:

```ts add={4}
import './App.css'
import { AdvancedImage } from '@cloudinary/react';
import { Cloudinary } from "@cloudinary/url-gen";
import { fill } from "@cloudinary/url-gen/actions/resize";
```

Then, use the `resize` action on the image:

```ts add={3}
  const myImage = cld.image('docs/models'); 

  myImage.resize(fill().width(250).height(250));
```
